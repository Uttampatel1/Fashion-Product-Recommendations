3. **Python App**: To run the app for creating image embeddings of the recommendation system, execute the following command in your terminal:

   python app.py
   ```

   This will launch the command-line interface where you can input your preferences and receive outfit recommendations.

## Demo 🎥

For a quick demonstration of the recommendation system, you can run the `test.py` script:

python test.py
```

This will showcase how the recommendation system works using predefined inputs.

## Live App 🌐

To access the interactive web-based version of the recommendation system, you can use Streamlit. Make sure you have Streamlit installed:
