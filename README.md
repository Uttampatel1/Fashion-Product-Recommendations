# Fashion Cloth Recommendations 👗👔

Welcome to the Fashion Cloth Recommendations project! This application helps you discover stylish outfit ideas based on your preferences. Whether you're looking for everyday wear, special occasions, or just want to experiment with your style, this app has got you covered. 💃🕺

## Getting Started 🚀

Follow these steps to set up and run the application:

1. **Image Folder**: Start by adding all the clothing item images you want the recommendation system to consider. You can place these images in the `Image` folder within the project directory.
2. Create a **models folder** in the root directory.

3. **Python App**: To run the app for creating image embeddings of the recommendation system, execute the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   This will launch the command-line interface where you can input your preferences and receive outfit recommendations.

## Demo 🎥

For a quick demonstration of the recommendation system, you can run the `test.py` script:

```bash
python test.py
```

This will showcase how the recommendation system works using pre-defined inputs.

## Live App 🌐

To access the interactive web-based version of the recommendation system, you can use Streamlit. Make sure you have Streamlit installed:

```bash
pip install streamlit
```

Then, run the `main.py` script:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

This will open a web browser with the live application. You can interact with the user-friendly interface to select your preferences and see instant fashion recommendations. 💻👗
